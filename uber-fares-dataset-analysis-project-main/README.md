## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Data Understanding and Preparation
- **Initial Dataset:** 200,000 rows, 9 columns
- **Data Quality Issues Identified:**
  - Missing values in coordinates (1 row)
  - Negative fare amounts (22 rows)
  - Extreme outliers in fares and coordinates
  - Invalid passenger counts

### 2. Data Cleaning Process
- Removed missing coordinate data
- Filtered out negative and zero fares
- Applied IQR method for outlier detection
